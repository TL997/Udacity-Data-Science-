# Udacity-Data-Science-
This is the last project of three projects from Udacity. 

Therefore, I uploaded my second project which had the following goal.

Provide the user with an interactive experience in exploring bikeshare data from three major US cities.



I completed this project by solving three main issues:

Firstly, I completed the practice questions and adopted them to the project.

Secondly, I ha to figure out further statistical calculations in order to provide comprehensive analysis of the bikeshare data.

Thirdly, I experienced a challenge when providing the user with the option to look at the raw data (in steps of five rows).



Overall, I enjoyed the project and find the structure of the Udacity very useful to learn programming languages as the projects help a lot to get a first experience.
